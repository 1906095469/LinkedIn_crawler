# LinkedIn_crawler

I have a list of target people, and I want to download their profiles from LinkedIn. These people all have experience in XXX company.

Here is my stragety:
1. Use Google to search "XXX linkedin NAME", and save links containing "linkedin"
2. Login LinkedIn by get(url) where url is the links from step 1
